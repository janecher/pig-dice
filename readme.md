## Description

_Two players take turns rolling dice. For every number rolled other than one, that number is added to the player's score. They will have the option to hold, or roll again. If a player rolls a 1, their turn is over and their accumulated score for that turn is lost. If a player chooses to hold, they will keep the score they have accumulated. The first player to reach 100 points is the winner!_
